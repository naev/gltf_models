**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This plugin has been merged into mainline Naev as of 0.12.0-alpha.2. No need to use it anymore, in fact, it's probably detrimaental.

This repository exists to get the 3D models ready in gltf format for use in game. It's designed to be usable as a plugin, and when put in the plugin directory, will activate 3D model for the existing models.
